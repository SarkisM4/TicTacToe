# TicTacToe

The program is a where I utilize my knowledge in python functions to create a simple game of TicTacToe. 

- The game of TicTacToe allows up to two players, one being X and the other being O. 
- For each game, the players will have to compete in order to get three in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagnolly. 
- The game can result in a player winning/losing, or in a draw(when the board gets filled and none get three in a row)
- By the end of the game, the user is then allowed to decide if they would like to play again or not.
